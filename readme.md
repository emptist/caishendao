# Trading Tools Application

A Streamlit-based application for financial chart visualization, technical analysis, and AI-powered market insights.


## Bokeh Chart Sizing
The application uses Bokeh's `sizing_mode="stretch_width"` property for charts, which:
- Makes charts automatically expand to fill the available horizontal space
- Maintains a fixed height for consistent vertical scaling
- Provides better responsiveness across different screen sizes and layouts
- Works seamlessly with Streamlit's wide layout configuration
